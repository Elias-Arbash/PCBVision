# PCB-Vision: A Multiscene RGB-Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset of Printed Circuit Boards
[HZDR](https://hzdr.de) - [Hif_Exploration](https://www.iexplo.space/)
## Overview

Our primary focus is to enhance the non-invasive optical analysis of E-waste materials, specifically plastics and printed circuit boards (PCBs). We aim to develop a smart multisensor network that utilizes RGB cameras and hyperspectral imaging, along with other types of sensors, to improve the efficiency of the E-waste recycling industry. This involves providing both quantitative and qualitative information that aids in decision-making for subsequent sorting and processing.

## Research Paper

This GitHub repository corresponds to the research paper titled "PCB-Vision: A Multiscene RGB-Hyperspectral Benchmark Dataset of Printed Circuit Boards." The paper introduces the first RGB-Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) benchmark segmentation dataset for PCBs. You can access the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06528).

## Dataset Details

The dataset includes:
- RGB images of 53 PCBs scanned with a high-resolution RGB camera (Teledyne Dalsa C4020).
- 53 hyperspectral data cubes of those PCBs scanned with Specim FX10 in the VNIR range.
- Two segmentation ground truth files: 'General' and 'Monoseg' for 4 classes of interest - 'others,' 'IC,' 'Capacitor,' and 'Connectors.'

## Code Repository

The repository includes code to read, manipulate, and process large-scale data. It also provides examples of preprocessing and processing steps, such as dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) and image segmentation using 5 deep learning models.

### Requirements

To use the codes without errors, install the libraries listed in the Requirements.txt file. The codes require at least 1 GPU to run and handle the data.
